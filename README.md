## SELECT

### ‚û°Ô∏è Definition
The `SELECT` statement is used to **retrieve data from one or more tables** in a database.

### üîç Example Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

## WHERE
### ‚û°Ô∏è Definition
The `WHERE` clause is used to **filter records that fulfill a specified condition**.

### üîç Example Query

```sql
SELECT ContactName, City 
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany';
```

#### ‚úÖ Explanation 
This retrieves the ContactName and City columns only for customers in Germany.


## GROUP BY
### ‚û°Ô∏è Definition
The `GROUP BY` clause is used to **group rows sharing a property so aggregate functions** (like COUNT, SUM) can be applied to each group.

### üîç Example Query
```sql

SELECT Country, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;
```

### ‚úÖ Explanation
This counts the number of customers in each country and displays the country name with its respective count.


## ORDER BY
### ‚û°Ô∏è Definition
The `ORDER BY` clause is used to **sort the result set in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order**.

### üîç Example Query
```sql

SELECT TOP 5 ProductName, Price
FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;
```

### ‚úÖ Explanation
This lists the top 5 most expensive products from the Products table in descending order of price.

### üí° Note:
In SQL Server, use TOP instead of LIMIT (which is used in MySQL/SQLite).


## JOIN
‚û°Ô∏è Definition
A `JOIN` clause is used to **combine rows from two or more tables**, based on a related column between them.

### üîç Example Query

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.ContactName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

### ‚úÖ Explanation
This returns a combined table showing each OrderID with the ContactName of the customer who placed the order.
